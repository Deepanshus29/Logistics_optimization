## Introduction:
In the world of logistics, time and distance are critical factors that can significantly impact the efficiency of operations. The ability to accurately estimate the time and distance required for a courier to travel from one location to another is essential for companies to provide reliable and timely delivery services to their customers. One way to estimate travel time and distance is by using Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM), an open-source software that calculates the fastest route between two points.
The objective of this data analysis project is to compare the actual time taken by a courier to the estimated time and distance calculated by OSRM. To achieve this goal, we collected data from a logistics company and analyzed it using various statistical techniques. By comparing the actual time taken to the estimated time calculated by OSRM, we aim to identify any discrepancies and determine the accuracy of the OSRM software.

The results of this study can also help companies identify areas for improvement and invest in technologies that can enhance the accuracy of their travel time and distance estimates.
Overall, this data analysis project has the potential to provide valuable insights into the accuracy of OSRM and its impact on the logistics industry.
